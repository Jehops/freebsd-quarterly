=== Emacs Ports

Contact: Emacs Ports Team <emacs@FreeBSD.org>

The Emacs development port, editors/emacs-devel, continues to be updated twice
per month to synchronize with the HEAD of upstream's master branch.  A
noteworthy change from the first June 2021 update was the addition of a
NATIVECOMP port option [1].  NATIVECOMP adds support for compiling Emacs lisp to
native code using libgccjit, which was first enabled in lang/gcc11-devel [2]
and is now in lang/gcc11.

For more information about native compilation of Emacs lisp, see
